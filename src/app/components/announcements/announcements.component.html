                <h4>NSFAS STATEMENT ON THE PROTEST BY  SOME UNIVERSITY STUDENTS </h4>
                <p style="opacity: 0.6;">Department | 12 May 2023 </p>
                <p >The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has called for an urgent meeting with the officials of SAUS. This follows a protest by  some university students, among whom there were SRC representatives from some universities. Ordinarily, the NSFAS engages with an organised body of Student Representative Councils, under the banner of SAUS which cuts across the political divide. Notwithstanding this and regardless of the fact that the protestors arrived unannounced, NSFAS management received their memorandum and subsequently engaged with them.  NSFAS holds the principle of engagement with stakeholders in high regard, as evident in the various physical visits to institutions and various sessions with stakeholders. Furthermore, in observance of the principle of engagement with student leaders, the CEO had an engagement with the CPUT SRC just a day before the unannounced protest where several issues affecting students were clarified.  We note that very few issues in the memorandum have to do with the sphere of NSFAS operations. We will however, over and above the engagements we have had with students continue to communicate developments and progress on the issues. </p>
